üéÆ Project Overview

The 2D Project Start template is inspired by the "Dodge the Creeps!" tutorial from the official Godot documentation. This game involves a player character that moves to avoid enemies, aiming to survive as long as possible. The template includes:

    Player Movement: Basic controls for player navigation.

    Enemy Spawning: Random generation of enemy characters.

    Score System: Tracks and displays the player's score.

    Game Over Logic: Ends the game when the player collides with an enemy.

‚öôÔ∏è Features

    Godot Engine 4.0: Built with the latest stable version of Godot.

    GDScript: Utilizes Godot's native scripting language for logic implementation.

    Scene Organization: Well-structured scenes for easy navigation and modification.

    Responsive UI: Basic user interface elements for score display and game over screen.
